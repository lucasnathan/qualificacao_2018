We discuss the economics of fake news and present new data on its consumption prior to the election. Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: 1) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their "most important" source; 2) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; 3) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and 4) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.},

	abstract = {The popularization of online social networks has contributed to the appearance of new strategies that consider the relationship and interaction between people as a means to support information search and recommendation. The literature has indicated that a cognitive authority produces and shares information of better quality and relevance for those who recognizes that authority, being a promising concept to support information retrieval and quality judgement on the web. However, identifying such authorities is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce the idAuthority: a conceptual framework to support the identification of cognitive authorities in social networks. To illustrate its application in a practical context, we instantiate the framework for a real online social network of Inclusive Education teachers, and evaluate its results with a group of six teachers. The results indicate the idAuthority as a promising framework to support the creation of mechanisms for identifying cognitive authorities in specific social networks.},

and dimensions of each, and discusses major theoretical frameworks tested and proposed in library and
information science (LIS) and related fields. It also lays out the fundamental notions of credibility and
cognitive authority in historical contexts to trace the evolution of the understanding and enhancement of
the two concepts. This entry contends that the assessment of information credibility and cognitive
authority is a ubiquitous human activity given that people constantly make decisions and selections based
on values of information in a variety of information seeking and use contexts. It further contends that
information credibility and cognitive authority assessment can be seen as an ongoing and iterative process
rather than a discrete information evaluation event. The judgments made in assessment processes are
highly subjective given their dependence on individuals??? accumulated beliefs, existing knowledge, and
prior experiences. The conclusion of this entry suggests the need for more research by emphasizing the
contributions that credibility and cognitive authority research can make to the field of LIS.},

Also, evaluation approaches have been developed in order to assess the appropriateness of a modeling approach in a given context. Both modeling and evaluation approaches, however, lack epistemological rigor, leading to problems regarding the applicability of a certain modeling language in a given context on the one hand, and regarding the feasibility of certain evaluation approaches towards certain modeling questions on the other hand. We therefore argue for a philosophical-paradigmatic discussion of evaluation methods for conceptual modeling languages in order to assess their applicability in given modeling contexts and present our research in progress towards a framework for paradigmatic discussion on model evaluation.},

An important and necessary part of the research was the acquiring of representative mine environmental and coal production data and a number of shortcomings were identified in this area. The monitored data was used to build univariate time series models of general air body methane concentration, air velocity, barometric pressure, coal production and methane drainage variables of varying timescales according to the Box-Jenkins method of time series analysis. The univariate models were used to identify causal relationships between methane concentration and its explanatory variables. Coal production was found to be the dominant variable in the determination of the quantity of methane emitted and where appropriate, multivariate time series models were built in which expressions for methane concentration in terms of coal production were obtained. Forecasts of methane concentration values were generated from both univariate and multivariate models and a comparison was made of their forecasting capabilities. Finally, suggestions were made as to the potential use of time series models for application to mining process control.}
